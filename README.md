This project was set by the British Airways Virtual Work Experience programme hosted by Forage.

For the first task was to scrape and analyse customer review data from Skytrax to extrapolate insights. I gathered 1000 of the most recent reviews, cleaned the data and performed sentiment analysis.

The second task involved designing a model to predict customer booking behaviour. For this I built a predictive Random Forest and fed into it data provided by Forage.
